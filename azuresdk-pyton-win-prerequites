# Prerequisites: 
# 0. install Python - i.e. with Anaconda or conda, that installs pyton 3, 2.7, Jupyter and popular libraries
#   https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/
#   or directly: https://www.python.org/downloads/ (python 3.x.x, i.e. as of writing version 3.7.3 19/06/11;  2.7 is old!)
#   
# 0.1 make sure that pip is the latest
#   cd \program files\python\
#   python.exe -m pip install --upgrade pip
#
# (optional) Jupyter Notebook formerly IPython Notebooks - web based developing tool http://ipython.org/notebook.html
# to run it locally install it via python pip
#   python -m pip install jupyther
# run the notebook locally and open browser with http://localhost:8888 (server listens to localhost port 8888)
#   (for a custom port use "--port 9999"; to skip opening the browser use "--no-browser", moe options with "--help")
#    jupyter notebook 
# open specific ipynb:
#   jupyter notebook test.ipynb
# use web based trial: https://try.jupyter.org/

# 1. Download and install the Python Azure SDK
# https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/python/azure/python-sdk-azure-install?view=azure-python
# 1.1 install using pip
#    pip install azure 
# 1.2 install from GIT
#   git clone git://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python.git
#   cd azure-sdk-for-python
#   python setup.py install

# 2. Need to have a Microsoft Azure account. 
# Help For "Using Python with Microsoft Azure: Python Developer Center"

# 2.1. Authenticate with Azure
#    Store the credentials securely in a configuration file, the registry, or Azure KeyVault.
#    The following example uses a Service Principal for authentication.
#   Note: To create a service principal with the Azure CLI, use the following command:
#      az ad sp create-for-rbac --name "MY-PRINCIPAL-NAME" --password "STRONG-SECRET-PASSWORD"
